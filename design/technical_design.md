## PixelImage

The PixelImage class is at the heart of VICar. It models an image with certain restrictions. It supports modelling the
restrictions of the Commodore 64 homecomputer, but is more generic.
The PixelImage
- Made up of a fixed number of pixels.
- Pixels take their color values from a pre-defined palette.
- Possible values of pixel colors are organized in so-called ColorMaps
